## How to Play

### Tic Tac Toe

1. Two players take turns marking their symbols (X or O) on a 3 x 3 grid.
2. The first player who gets three marks in a row wins. It can be a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row.

### Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock

1. The user can simply press any of the five buttons (Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, and Spock) to play a round.
2. The computer randomly chooses their option and shows the result: Win, Lose, or Tie.
3. If the user wants to play again, press the 'Play Again!' button.
4. Rock wins Scissors and Lizard, but loses to Paper and Spock.

### Casino Craps

1. The user rolls a pair of dice to compute the total. 
2. If the total is 2, 3, or 12 (craps), the player loses. If the total is 7 or 11 (natural), the player wins.
3. If the total is any other number (point), the player keeps rolling the dice to win until they get the same total (point). From now, the numbers 2,3,11, and 12 are no longer special. 
4. If the user gets 7 before getting the same number (point), they lose.
